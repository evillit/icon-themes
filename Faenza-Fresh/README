Have you ever installed a new, cool app and then discovered that there is no Faenza icon for it?
Probably yes.
This is why Faenza-Fresh exists. The goal of this extension set is to provide Faenza icons for anything the actual official icon pack doesn't include icons for and, if the official icon for something doesn't look good, provide a better one.
The long-term-goal is that these or similar icons get included in the official Faenza icon set, so that every application, device, action or whatever has a Faenza icon.


Faenza Fresh currently includes about 90 icons for applications, with many new icons (which Faenza doesn't include yet) such as Jack, Code::Blocks, Kompozer, Git or Scribes but also many reworked Faenza icons such as Firefox, LibreOffice (well, not exactly; my Faenza Libreoffice icons existed before the official ones), Pidgin, Banshee or Inkscape.

*	INSTALLATION:						      *
*								      *
***********************************************************************

1)	Personal (just for you): Copy the "Faenza-Fresh"-folder into the folder /home/yourname/.icons/
	System (for every user): Copy the "Faenza-Fresh"-folder into the folder /usr/share/icons/

2)	After that, use "Faenza-Fresh" instead of "Faenza" as your icon theme.

3)	Enjoy your new icons!



By default, if Faenza-Cupertino (the blue Faenza folders) is installed, that folders are used. if you like the official ones better, change the "Inherits" in the index.theme. Just delete "Faenza-Cupertino" in that line.

***********************************************************************

Some Icons currently don't work (if you know why and how this could be fixed, let me know):

Fontforge
Alchemy
Wesnoth
Synfig
MeMaker
TeamViewer
Dolphin
Gespeaker
Git-Cola
Goldendict
Gresistor
Gunity
Hydrogen
Jack Rack
Jack EQ
MuseScore
Oregano
Unison
Xoscope

Synapse icon replaces monochromatic panel icon
small-sized icons aren't perfect (i didn't want to loose too much time on doing that since in both GNOME Shell and Unity applications don't need small icons)

If one of your favourite apps doesn't have a Faenza icon, feel free to contact me, so maybe the next version will include it;)
